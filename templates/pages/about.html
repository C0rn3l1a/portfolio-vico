            ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Victoria, or Vico for short.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Perth, grew up in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, and now live in Melbourne. My experiences
            growing up in different places have made me adaptable and given me a unique perspective when
            it comes to problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            With a bachelorâ€™s degree in Graphic Design from Blas Pascal University, my passion for UX/UI
            design grew as I discovered its ability to combine creativity with data-driven insights and usability
            testing. My thesis focused on redesigning the Hoyts Self-Serve Kiosk to enhance the user
            experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a UX/UI designer, handling everything from strategy to
            delivering polished, user-friendly products. I believe great design should not only solve problems
            but also inspire and connect with people.

            My other hobbies include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Avid Dungeons and Dragons player. I love playing D&D because it fosters creativity, collaboration, and immersive storytelling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proud cat owner. At home, I'm accompanied by Madame, my loyal feline companion, who provides endless inspiration and motivation as I work.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
